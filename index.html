								<h2>Hi ! I'm Pavan </h2>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Pavan M Reddy is a Mechanical Engineer at Biosphere, where he ideates, designs, and prototypes bench-top bioreactor systems. With a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley, Pavan has a robust foundation in mechanical principles and product design. He is a technology enthusiast with a keen interest in sustainable solutions and human-centered design.<br>

Pavan's industrial experience is diverse and impactful. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he contributed to developing low-cost PSA oxygen concentrators for the Indian government, significantly enhancing their efficiency and reducing their size. He also has experience in the fabrication and assembly of PSA oxygen plants, leading his team to achieve sustainable designs.<br>

Previously, Pavan worked at Blue Goji on the development of an omnidirectional treadmill integrated with VR, aimed at treating Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. This project aligns with his commitment to engineering solutions that have a societal impact. In addition to his hands-on experience, Pavan has conducted research on Fluid-Structure Interaction using open-source tools, aiming to reduce the computational costs associated with these studies.<br>

Pavan holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology, MAHE. He is also expanding his knowledge in machine learning and statistical analysis to address complex engineering problems. His dedication to product design and sustainable engineering solutions underscores his commitment to making a positive impact in the field of Mechanical Engineering.</p>
